# MEAN-VARIANCE-AND-CROSSCORRELATION
# Simulation of Mean and Variance Using Scilab

## Aim
To write a program for **mean**, **variance**, and **cross-correlation** in Scilab and verify the output.
 
---

## Equipment Needed
- Computer with i3 Processor  
- Scilab Software

---

## Algorithm
1. **Define the Function:** Specify the function you want to simulate. For example, `f(x) = sin(x)` or any other function.  
2. **Generate Sample Points:** Decide on the range and the number of sample points. Generate these sample points within the desired range.  
3. **Evaluate the Function:** Compute the function values at each of these sample points.  
4. **Compute Mean, Variance, and Cross-Correlation:** Use Scilab's functions to calculate the mean and variance of the computed function values.  
5. **Display Results:** Output the computed mean, variance, and cross-correlation.

## Procedure
1. Refer to the algorithm and write code for the experiment.  
2. Open **Scilab** on your system.  
3. Type your code in a new editor.  
4. Save the file.  
5. Execute the code.  
6. If any errors occur, correct the code and execute again.  
7. Verify the generated results.

## Output

### Mean Values
- Mean of X = 0.3011687
- Mean of Y = 0.25

### Variance Values
- Variance of X = 0.0092974 
- Variance of Y = 0.0375000

### Cross-Correlation Input Example
- Reference sequence: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`  
- Second sequence: `[2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 3, 5, 9]`
